## What Is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a tool that banks and lenders use to decide who they should extend credit to. These institutions don't personally know you or your spending habits, and because they process so many people, they rely on an algorithm to evaluate risk. The score reflects your creditworthiness; how likely you are to repay borrowed money.

Ultimately, a bank is a business. When they give you a loan or credit, they're effectively selling you a product that you pay back in terms of interest. The score helps them determine if lending to you is a safe bet or a potential loss.

> **The general rule:** If someone has been extended credit but chooses not to use it, maintains it over a long period, and consistently pays on time for any credit they do use, they are typically seen as trustworthy by banks. This behavior signals financial responsibility and low risk.

## Core Principles

These four habits have the biggest impact on your score. Start here.

### Pay All Bills on Time

Payment history accounts for 35% of your score. Late payments hurt, and the damage sticks around for years.

- [ ] Set up automatic payments for all credit accounts
- [ ] Create calendar reminders for bills that can't be automated
- [ ] If you miss a payment, pay it immediately; the longer you wait, the worse the impact

### Resolve Negative Marks Immediately

If you have accounts in collections or other negative marks, resolve them quickly. A paid collection looks better than an unpaid one, and clearing these issues can help improve your score over time.

- [ ] Pull your credit report to identify any negative marks
- [ ] Contact collection agencies to negotiate payment or removal
- [ ] Get any agreements in writing before paying

### Maintain Low Credit Utilization

Keep the balances on your credit cards well below their limits. Utilization (how much you owe vs. your credit limit) is a major factor in your score.

- [ ] Aim for utilization under 30% at minimum
- [ ] For maximum impact, keep utilization under 5-10%
- [ ] Track utilization across individual cards and your total available credit

> **Why does utilization matter?** If you're using most of your available credit, lenders worry you're overextended and might not be able to pay. Low utilization signals you have credit available but don't need to rely on it.

### Use Credit Responsibly

Avoid overextending yourself or maxing out your cards. Responsible use builds trust with lenders.

- [ ] Only charge what you can afford to pay off
- [ ] Treat credit cards as a payment tool, not a loan
- [ ] Have a plan before making any large purchase

## Additional Strategies

These are important but secondary to the core principles above.

### Increase Credit Limits Strategically

Higher credit limits mean more available credit and lower utilization. Just don't use the extra headroom to spend more.

- [ ] Request credit limit increases every six months
- [ ] Call or use online banking to make the request
- [ ] Don't be surprised by high limits; $10,000, $50,000, or even $100,000 limits are common for established borrowers
- [ ] Limits are often a factor of your income; report income increases to your card issuers

> **Why does this help?** If you have $1,000 in balances and $5,000 in limits, you're at 20% utilization. Get those limits raised to $20,000 and that same $1,000 balance is only 5% utilization.

### Diversify Your Credit Portfolio

A mix of credit types helps your score. Lenders like seeing you can handle different kinds of debt.

- [ ] Revolving credit (credit cards)
- [ ] Installment loans (car loans, mortgages, personal loans)
- [ ] Consider having around 5 different credit cards, even if some are unused

> **Personal note:** I've found that 5 different credit cards, even if they're all unused, has been the sweet spot for me personally. The extra available credit helps utilization, and the account diversity looks good to lenders.

### Avoid Closing Old Accounts

Keep old accounts open to maintain the average age of your credit history. Even if you don't use a card, its age helps your score.

- [ ] Put a small recurring charge on old cards to keep them active
- [ ] Set up autopay so you don't forget about them
- [ ] Any unused credit counts toward your available credit, which you want to be as high as possible

### Use Asset-Backed Loans Wisely

Loans like mortgages or car loans can add diversity to your credit profile and show your ability to handle long-term financial commitments.

- [ ] Make all loan payments on time
- [ ] Understand that these loans build credit history over their full term
- [ ] Don't take on debt just for credit building; only borrow what you need

## Credit Card Usage Tips

Practical advice for everyday credit card management.

### Use at Least One Credit Card Regularly

Pick a card with the best perks for your spending, such as cash back or travel rewards, and use it for everyday expenses.

- [ ] Choose a primary card that rewards your most common spending categories
- [ ] Use the card for all regular purchases to maximize rewards
- [ ] Keep backup cards for situations where your primary isn't accepted

### Pay the Full Statement Balance Each Month

To avoid interest charges, always pay the full balance by the due date.

- [ ] Set up autopay for the statement balance (not minimum payment)
- [ ] Use a card with a grace period where interest doesn't accrue until after the first billing cycle
- [ ] Never carry a balance if you can avoid it; interest adds up fast

### Set a Budget

Track your spending to ensure you don't exceed what you can afford to pay off in full each month.

- [ ] Use budgeting software (YNAB, "You Need a Budget," is excellent; there are others)
- [ ] Review spending weekly to stay on track
- [ ] Budgeting helps you manage cash flow so autopay doesn't overdraft your checking account

## Minor But Helpful Practices

These won't make or break your score, but they support good credit hygiene.

### Regularly Check Your Credit Report

Review your credit report at least once a year to catch and dispute any errors.

- [ ] Use [annualcreditreport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/) for free reports from all three bureaus
- [ ] Dispute any inaccuracies you find
- [ ] Check for accounts you don't recognize (could indicate fraud)

### Limit New Credit Inquiries

Each hard inquiry can slightly lower your score, so only apply for credit when necessary.

- [ ] Space out credit applications
- [ ] Don't apply for new cards right before a major purchase (mortgage, car loan)
- [ ] Know the difference between hard and soft inquiries (see FAQ below)

### Keep Zero-Balance Cards with High Limits

Even if unused, zero-balance cards with high credit limits contribute positively to your utilization rate.

- [ ] Don't close cards just because you're not using them
- [ ] Consider putting a small recurring charge on them to prevent automatic closure

### Plan Large Purchases Carefully

If you need to carry a balance temporarily, plan ahead to pay it off quickly to avoid impacting your score.

- [ ] Know your statement closing date vs. due date
- [ ] If possible, pay large charges before the statement closes to keep reported utilization low
- [ ] Have a payoff plan before making any purchase you can't pay off immediately

## Quick Tips

**Automatic Payments:** Set your card payments on automatic to pay the statement balance every month. If you stay in your budget, you should have plenty of funds in your checking to cover the statement balance of the card.

**Use Alerts:** Many credit card apps allow you to set up alerts for due dates, spending limits, or approaching your credit limit.

**Use Your Rewards:** Get cashback or travel points for spending you'd do anyway. Just don't let chasing rewards tempt you into buying things you don't need.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is it that I have a better score with active lines of credit? Isn't that counterintuitive?

It seems backwards, but banks want to see you use credit, not avoid it. Someone with no credit history is an unknown risk. Someone with years of borrowing and paying it back on time? That's a proven track record.

### How does having multiple credit cards impact my credit score?

Multiple credit cards help if you manage them well. More cards means more available credit (lower utilization) and more history. But opening a bunch at once dings you with hard inquiries and drags down your average account age. Space out applications and only open cards you'll actually use.

### What's the difference between a soft inquiry and a hard inquiry on my credit report?

A **soft inquiry** occurs when you or a company checks your credit for non-lending purposes, such as pre-approval offers, background checks, or checking your own score. These don't affect your score.

A **hard inquiry** happens when you apply for credit (credit cards, loans, mortgages). It can temporarily lower your score by a few points. Multiple hard inquiries in a short period for the same type of loan (mortgage, auto) are usually grouped together and counted as one inquiry.

### How can I improve my score quickly if I'm planning a big purchase soon?

To improve your score quickly:

- [ ] Pay down credit card balances to lower your utilization rate
- [ ] Dispute any errors on your credit report
- [ ] Avoid opening new accounts (no new hard inquiries)
- [ ] Make multiple small payments within a billing cycle (instead of one large payment) to keep your reported balance low

> **Note:** There's no magic fix. If your score is low due to missed payments or collections, those take time to age off your report. Focus on what you can control now; utilization is the fastest lever you can pull.
