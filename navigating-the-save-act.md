# Navigating the SAVE Act

The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. While the bill's future remains uncertain, it's a good reminder to verify your voter registration is current and that your signature on file actually matches how you sign things today.

This guide covers what the SAVE Act proposes, how to check your registration in Salt Lake County, and how to ensure your ballot won't get flagged for a signature mismatch.

## What Is the SAVE Act?

The SAVE Act (H.R. 22 in the 119th Congress) would require voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote. It passed the House in early 2025 but still needs Senate approval.

### What the bill would require

- **Documentary proof of citizenship** for new voter registrations and updates
- **In-person document presentation** at election offices (no more mail-in registration)
- States to **remove noncitizens** from voter rolls

### Acceptable documents under the proposal

The bill accepts several forms of proof:

- U.S. passport (valid or expired)
- Birth certificate issued by a U.S. state or territory
- Certificate of naturalization
- Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA)
- REAL ID-compliant driver's license or ID that indicates citizenship
- Military ID with citizenship indicator

If you don't have a photo ID showing citizenship, you'd need to present two documents: a government-issued photo ID plus separate citizenship documentation like a birth certificate.

> **Why this matters:** About 21 million voting-age Americans don't have easy access to citizenship documents. If you're among them, now is the time to request copies; don't wait until the law potentially takes effect.

## Misinformation vs. Reality

See [Misinformation vs. Reality](save-act/misinformation.md) for fact-checks on common claims, including:

- "Married women who changed their name can't vote" (mostly false, but with caveats)
- "Noncitizens are voting in large numbers" (not supported by evidence)
- "This bill just enforces existing law" (it goes further than current requirements)

---

## Check Your Voter Registration

Before worrying about new requirements, verify your current registration is accurate.

### State vs. County: Which do I use?

Utah has both state-level and county-level election resources. Here's when to use each:

| Task | Where to go |
|------|-------------|
| Register to vote or update registration | State: [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html) |
| Look up your registration status | Either works; state [VoteSearch](https://votesearch.utah.gov/voter-search/search/search-by-voter/voter-info) or [county lookup](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/register/check-voter-registration/) |
| Fix a flagged signature (cure letter) | County clerk |
| Questions about your ballot | County clerk |
| Report a problem on Election Day | County clerk |

The state portal is where your registration lives. Your county clerk is who actually processes your ballot and handles any issues. If you're in Salt Lake City, your county clerk is Salt Lake County.

### Look up your registration

- [ ] Use [VoteSearch Utah](https://votesearch.utah.gov/voter-search/search/search-by-voter/voter-info) or the [Salt Lake County lookup](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/register/check-voter-registration/)
- [ ] Verify your address, party affiliation, and precinct are correct
- [ ] Note your polling location and check your sample ballot
- [ ] Confirm your information matches your current driver's license

### Update your registration

- [ ] Go to [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html)
- [ ] Sign in and make your changes
- [ ] If updating your address, make sure your driver's license is updated first (wait 24 hours after updating with the Driver License Division)

> **Note:** The state portal requires your address to match Driver License Division records. If you've moved recently, update your license first, then wait 24 hours before updating voter registration online.

## Verify Your Signature

Utah verifies signatures on mail ballots. Every envelope gets compared against the signatures in your voter file (up to five stored signatures). If yours doesn't match, your ballot could be flagged.

### Why signatures get flagged

- Your signature has changed over time
- You signed differently than usual (rushed, injured hand, etc.)
- The signature on file is from years ago and no longer resembles your current one
- You changed your name and your new signature looks different

### How to update your signature

The most reliable way to update your signature is to re-register to vote:

- [ ] Visit [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html)
- [ ] Complete the registration form with your current information
- [ ] Sign using your current, consistent signature
- [ ] Submit the form (this updates your existing registration)

You can also submit a paper registration form at your county clerk's office or any post office.

> **Tip:** When you sign your ballot envelope, try to match how you signed your registration. Consistency matters more than elegance.

## What If Your Signature Doesn't Match?

If election officials can't verify your signature, they'll contact you before rejecting your ballot.

### The cure process

- [ ] Watch for a "cure letter" via mail, email, text, or phone from your county clerk
- [ ] Follow the instructions to sign an affidavit confirming your identity
- [ ] Return the affidavit before the deadline (typically a few days after Election Day)
- [ ] Your ballot will be counted once the affidavit is received

### Salt Lake County contact

If you receive a cure letter or have questions about your ballot status:

- **Phone:** (385) 468-7400
- **Website:** [Salt Lake County Elections](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/)

## Gather Your Documents Now

Whether or not the SAVE Act passes, having your citizenship documents accessible is useful for many purposes.

### Documents to locate or request

- [ ] Birth certificate (request from the state where you were born)
- [ ] U.S. passport (apply or renew at [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov))
- [ ] Naturalization certificate (request a replacement through [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov))
- [ ] REAL ID-compliant driver's license (check with your state DMV)

### If you've changed your name

If your current name doesn't match your birth certificate:

- [ ] Locate your marriage certificate or court order for name change
- [ ] Consider updating your passport to reflect your current name
- [ ] Ensure your voter registration name matches your ID

> **Why do this now?** Document requests can take weeks or months. If proof-of-citizenship requirements take effect, there may be a rush. Getting ahead of it costs nothing but a bit of time.

## Free Utah Voter ID

If you don't have a driver's license or state ID, Utah offers a zero-cost option for eligible residents.

### Who qualifies

Under [HB300](https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0300.html) (passed in 2025), you can get a free state ID card if you:

- Are 18 or older
- Have not been issued a Utah driver's license
- Are eligible to register to vote
- Sign an affidavit stating you are indigent (unable to afford the standard fee)

### How to get one

- [ ] Visit a [Utah Driver License Division office](https://dld.utah.gov/) in person
- [ ] Bring documents proving your identity and date of birth (birth certificate, passport, etc.)
- [ ] Bring proof of Utah residency (utility bill, bank statement, etc.)
- [ ] Sign the indigency affidavit
- [ ] Receive a temporary ID; your permanent card arrives by mail within 6 weeks

> **Tip:** Schedule an appointment online at [dld.utah.gov](https://dld.utah.gov/) to avoid long wait times.

### Current ID requirements for voting

Until stricter requirements phase in (2028-2029), Utah accepts flexible ID options:

**One photo ID:**
- Utah driver's license or state ID
- U.S. passport
- Tribal ID
- Military ID
- Utah concealed carry permit

**Or two non-photo documents** that together show your name and address:
- Utility bill (within 90 days)
- Bank statement
- Birth certificate
- Social Security card
- Paycheck or government check

If you show up without valid ID, you can cast a provisional ballot and provide ID to your county clerk by the Monday after Election Day.
