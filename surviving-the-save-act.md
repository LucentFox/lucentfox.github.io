# Surviving the SAVE Act

The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. An expanded version, the SAVE America Act (H.R. 7296), passed the House on February 11, 2026, adding photo ID requirements for voting. This guide covers what the bills propose, how to check your registration in Salt Lake County, and how to ensure your ballot won't get flagged for a signature mismatch.

### What this guide covers

- [ ] Check your Utah voter registration
- [ ] Verify your signature is current
- [ ] Understand which documents prove citizenship
- [ ] Separate fact from misinformation

## Bills Affecting Voting

Four bills are shaping voter requirements: two federal, two state. See [Bills Affecting Voting](save-act/bills.md) for full details.

| Bill | Status | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **SAVE Act** (H.R. 22, federal) | Stalled in Senate; superseded by H.R. 7296 | Required citizenship documents to register; eliminated online/mail registration |
| **SAVE America Act** (H.R. 7296, federal) | Passed House Feb 11, 2026 (~20% chance in Senate) | Everything in the SAVE Act, plus photo ID for in-person voting and ID copies for absentee ballots |
| **HB300** (Utah) | Law (signed Mar 2025) | Phases out auto mail voting by 2029; requires last 4 of ID on envelope. Early testing raised security concerns; corrective bills pending. |
| **HB479** (Utah) | In committee | Would require in-person ballot return with ID; $10M+ cost a concern |

## Misinformation vs. Reality

See [Misinformation vs. Reality](save-act/misinformation.md) for fact-checks on common claims, including:

- "Married women who changed their name can't vote" (mostly false, but with caveats)
- "Noncitizens are voting in large numbers" (not supported by evidence)
- "This bill just enforces existing law" (it goes further than current requirements)
- "Your REAL ID proves citizenship" (false for most states, including Utah)

## Check Your Voter Registration

Before worrying about new requirements, verify your current registration is accurate.

### State vs. County: Which do I use?

Utah has both state-level and county-level election resources. Here's when to use each:

| Task | Where to go |
|------|-------------|
| Register to vote or update registration | State: [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html) |
| Look up your registration status | Either works; state [VoteSearch](https://votesearch.utah.gov/voter-search/search/search-by-voter/voter-info) or [county lookup](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/register/check-voter-registration/) |
| Fix a flagged signature (cure letter) | County clerk |
| Questions about your ballot | County clerk |
| Report a problem on Election Day | County clerk |

The state portal is where your registration lives. Your county clerk is who actually processes your ballot and handles any issues. If you're in Salt Lake City, your county clerk is Salt Lake County.

### Look up your registration

- [ ] Use [VoteSearch Utah](https://votesearch.utah.gov/voter-search/search/search-by-voter/voter-info) or the [Salt Lake County lookup](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/register/check-voter-registration/)
- [ ] Verify your address, party affiliation, and precinct are correct
- [ ] Note your polling location and check your sample ballot
- [ ] Confirm your information matches your current driver's license

### Update your registration

- [ ] Go to [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html)
- [ ] Sign in and make your changes
- [ ] If updating your address, make sure your driver's license is updated first (wait 24 hours after updating with the Driver License Division)

> **Note:** The state portal requires your address to match Driver License Division records. If you've moved recently, update your license first, then wait 24 hours before updating voter registration online.

## Verify Your Signature

Utah verifies signatures on mail ballots. Every envelope gets compared against your voter file (up to five stored signatures). If yours doesn't match, your ballot could be flagged.

### Why signatures get flagged

- Your signature has changed over time
- The signature on file is years old
- You changed your name and sign differently now

### How to update your signature

Re-register to vote at [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html). Complete the form and sign using your current, consistent signature. You can also submit a paper form at your county clerk's office.

### If your signature doesn't match

**Ballots:** Election officials will contact you before rejecting your ballot. Watch for a "cure letter" via mail, email, text, or phone. Sign the affidavit and return it before the deadline (typically a few days after Election Day).

**Petitions:** No cure process. If your signature doesn't match your voter file, it's simply invalidated. This matters if you sign ballot initiative or candidate petitions.

**Salt Lake County:** (385) 468-7400 | vote@saltlakecounty.gov | [saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/)
