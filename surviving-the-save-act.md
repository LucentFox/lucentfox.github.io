## What Is the SAVE Act?

The SAVE Act (H.R. 22 in the 119th Congress) would require voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote. It passed the House in early 2025 but still needs Senate approval.

### Current law vs. proposed

| | Current | SAVE Act |
|---|---------|----------|
| **What you prove** | Identity (attestation of citizenship) | Citizenship (documentary proof) |
| **How you register** | Online, by mail, or in person | In person only |
| **Documents needed** | Photo ID or two non-photo docs | Passport, birth certificate, or similar |

For the full list of acceptable documents, see [ID Requirements & Documents](save-act/id-requirements.md).

## Misinformation vs. Reality

See [Misinformation vs. Reality](save-act/misinformation.md) for fact-checks on common claims, including:

- "Married women who changed their name can't vote" (mostly false, but with caveats)
- "Noncitizens are voting in large numbers" (not supported by evidence)
- "This bill just enforces existing law" (it goes further than current requirements)
- "Your REAL ID proves citizenship" (false for most states, including Utah)

## Check Your Voter Registration

Before worrying about new requirements, verify your current registration is accurate.

### State vs. County: Which do I use?

Utah has both state-level and county-level election resources. Here's when to use each:

| Task | Where to go |
|------|-------------|
| Register to vote or update registration | State: [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html) |
| Look up your registration status | Either works; state [VoteSearch](https://votesearch.utah.gov/voter-search/search/search-by-voter/voter-info) or [county lookup](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/register/check-voter-registration/) |
| Fix a flagged signature (cure letter) | County clerk |
| Questions about your ballot | County clerk |
| Report a problem on Election Day | County clerk |

The state portal is where your registration lives. Your county clerk is who actually processes your ballot and handles any issues. If you're in Salt Lake City, your county clerk is Salt Lake County.

### Look up your registration

- [ ] Use [VoteSearch Utah](https://votesearch.utah.gov/voter-search/search/search-by-voter/voter-info) or the [Salt Lake County lookup](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/register/check-voter-registration/)
- [ ] Verify your address, party affiliation, and precinct are correct
- [ ] Note your polling location and check your sample ballot
- [ ] Confirm your information matches your current driver's license

### Update your registration

- [ ] Go to [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html)
- [ ] Sign in and make your changes
- [ ] If updating your address, make sure your driver's license is updated first (wait 24 hours after updating with the Driver License Division)

> **Note:** The state portal requires your address to match Driver License Division records. If you've moved recently, update your license first, then wait 24 hours before updating voter registration online.

## Verify Your Signature

Utah verifies signatures on mail ballots. Every envelope gets compared against your voter file (up to five stored signatures). If yours doesn't match, your ballot could be flagged.

### Why signatures get flagged

- Your signature has changed over time
- The signature on file is years old
- You changed your name and sign differently now

### How to update your signature

Re-register to vote at [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html). Complete the form and sign using your current, consistent signature. You can also submit a paper form at your county clerk's office.

### If your signature doesn't match

Election officials will contact you before rejecting your ballot. Watch for a "cure letter" via mail, email, text, or phone. Sign the affidavit and return it before the deadline (typically a few days after Election Day).

**Salt Lake County:** (385) 468-7400 or [saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/)
