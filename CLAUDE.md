## Style

- Use plain, accessible language
- Prefer practical advice over theory
- Include explanatory "why" blocks for non-obvious recommendations
- Use `- [ ]` for checklist items (markdown checkboxes)
- Include full URLs in link text for printability
- Avoid em dashes; use semicolons or commas instead
