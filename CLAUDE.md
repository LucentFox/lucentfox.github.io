## Style

- Use plain, accessible language
- Prefer practical advice over theory
- Include explanatory "why" blocks for non-obvious recommendations
- Use `- [ ]` for checklist items (markdown checkboxes)
- Include full URLs in link text for printability
- Avoid em dashes; use semicolons or commas instead

## Avoiding AI Smell

Write like a person, not a language model. Common tells to avoid:

- **Overexplaining in parentheticals:** Don't insert "(even if you haven't been breached)" or similar qualifiers. Trust the reader.
- **Intensifiers that add nothing:** Skip "significantly," "dramatically," "incredibly," "extremely." If something matters, show why; don't just add adjectives.
- **Corporate filler words:** Avoid "leverage," "utilize," "robust," "comprehensive," "crucial," "essential." Use normal words.
- **Transition padding:** Cut "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Importantly," "It's worth noting that." Just say the thing.
- **Overly confident commands:** Soften absolutist language. "You should" or "consider" reads more human than "You must" or "Always do X."
- **Performative enthusiasm:** No "Great question!" or "That's a really smart approach." Just answer.
- **Symmetrical structures:** Humans don't write in perfectly balanced triads or bullet points of identical length. Vary rhythm.

When in doubt, read it out loud. If it sounds like a press release or a chatbot, rewrite it.
