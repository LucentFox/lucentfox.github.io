# Misinformation vs. Reality

The SAVE Act has generated viral claims on both sides. Here's what's actually true.

## "Married women who changed their name can't vote"

**The claim:** If your last name doesn't match your birth certificate (because you took a spouse's name), you'll be rejected and unable to vote.

**The reality:** This is **mostly false**. The bill would not make married women ineligible to vote. [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/17/tiktok-posts/save-act-would-make-it-harder-not-impossible-for-m/) rated this claim "Mostly False," and [FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/will-save-act-prevent-married-women-from-registering-to-vote/) found it overstated.

The bill includes a provision requiring states to "establish a process" for handling name discrepancies. Voters could potentially provide additional documentation (like a marriage certificate) to resolve the mismatch.

**The legitimate concern:** The bill doesn't specify what additional documents states must accept or how the process would work. About 69 million women have changed their name through marriage, and roughly 34% of women lack citizenship documents matching their current legal name. Depending on how states implement the law, this could create real friction during registration, even if it doesn't outright prevent voting.

> **Bottom line:** You won't be "banned from voting" for changing your name, but you may face extra steps. If you have a passport in your current legal name, that sidesteps the issue entirely.

## "Noncitizens are voting in large numbers"

**The claim:** The SAVE Act is necessary because noncitizen voting is a widespread problem.

**The reality:** Multiple studies and audits have found noncitizen voting to be [extremely rare](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions). It's already a federal crime for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, imprisonment, and deportation. States already have processes to verify citizenship during registration.

The bill addresses a problem that functionally doesn't exist at scale, while creating documented barriers for millions of eligible citizens.

## "This bill just enforces existing law"

**The claim:** The SAVE Act simply requires proof of something that's already required.

**The reality:** It's true that only U.S. citizens can legally vote in federal elections. However, the SAVE Act goes further by requiring *documentary proof* at registration, eliminating online and mail-in registration, and mandating in-person visits to election offices. Current law allows voters to attest to citizenship under penalty of perjury; this bill would require physical documents.
