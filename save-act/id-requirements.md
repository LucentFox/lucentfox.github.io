# ID Requirements: Current vs. Proposed

This page covers what ID you need to vote in Utah today, what would change under the SAVE Act, and how to get the documents you need.

---

## Current Utah Requirements

These are the ID requirements in effect now. Utah has flexible options until stricter rules phase in (2028-2029 under HB300).

### One photo ID

Any of these works on its own (must be currently valid):

| Document |
|----------|
| Utah driver's license |
| State or federal government-issued ID card |
| Utah concealed carry permit |
| U.S. passport |
| Tribal ID (photo not required) |

### Or two documents showing name + residence

If you don't have a photo ID, use **two documents** that show your name and provide evidence you live in the precinct:

| Document | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Utility bill | Within 90 days |
| Bank or financial account statement | |
| Certified birth certificate | |
| Social Security card | |
| State or federal government check | |
| Paycheck | |
| Utah hunting or fishing license | Currently valid |
| U.S. military ID | Currently valid |
| Certified naturalization documents | Not a green card |
| Court records (adoption or name change) | Certified copy |
| Bureau of Indian Affairs card | |
| Tribal treaty card | |
| Medicaid, Medicare, or EBT card | Currently valid |
| Local government ID | Currently valid |
| Employer ID | Currently valid |
| College, university, or technical school ID | Currently valid, in-state school |
| Utah vehicle registration | Current |

### No ID at all?

You can still vote. Cast a provisional ballot and provide valid ID to your county clerk by the Monday after Election Day.

## Proposed SAVE Act Requirements

If the SAVE Act passes, the requirements would be stricter. You'd need to prove **citizenship**, not just identity.

### Standalone documents

Any one of these would be sufficient on its own:

| Document | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| U.S. passport (valid or expired) | Easiest option; shows citizenship directly |
| Enhanced Driver's License (EDL) | Only available in 6 states (see below); must indicate citizenship |
| Government photo ID showing U.S. birthplace | Must explicitly list birthplace in the U.S. |
| Military ID + service record | Service record must show U.S. birthplace |
| Certificate of naturalization | For naturalized citizens |
| Certificate of citizenship | For those who derived/acquired citizenship |

> **Warning: Most REAL IDs don't qualify.** The gold star means REAL ID compliant, not citizen. Only 6 states offer IDs that indicate citizenship:
> - **Enhanced Driver's Licenses:** Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, Washington
> - **Citizenship marker:** Idaho (optional, added 2023)
>
> **Utah is not on this list.** Your Utah driver's license (even with the gold star) must be paired with a birth certificate, or use a passport instead.

### Document pairs

If you don't have a standalone document, you'd need a **government-issued photo ID** plus **one citizenship document**:

| Photo ID | Citizenship Document |
|----------|----------------------|
| State driver's license or ID | Certified U.S. birth certificate |
| Tribal ID | Hospital record of birth (U.S.) |
| Other government photo ID | Consular Report of Birth Abroad |
| | Final adoption decree (U.S. citizenship) |
| | Certificate of naturalization |
| | Certificate of citizenship |
| | American Indian Card (KIC) |

Pick one from each column.

### Name change situations

If your current legal name doesn't match your birth certificate:

| Situation | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Have a passport in your current name | Use the passport alone (no other docs needed) |
| Birth certificate + marriage certificate | May work, but the bill doesn't explicitly guarantee this |
| Updated REAL ID in current name | Would work if it indicates citizenship |
| Court-ordered name change | Keep the court order with your birth certificate |

> **Safest approach:** Get a passport in your current legal name. It sidesteps name-matching issues entirely.

## Comparison: Current vs. Proposed

| | Current (Utah) | Proposed (SAVE Act) |
|---|----------------|---------------------|
| **What you prove** | Identity | Citizenship |
| **Photo ID alone** | Yes (many options) | Only if it shows citizenship/birthplace |
| **Non-photo options** | Yes (two documents) | No |
| **Birth certificate alone** | Yes (with one other doc) | Only with photo ID |
| **Passport** | Accepted | Accepted (preferred option) |
| **Provisional ballot** | Yes, cure by Monday after election | Unclear |
| **Online registration** | Yes | Would be eliminated |
| **Mail registration** | Yes | Would be eliminated |

## Document Checklist

Whether or not the SAVE Act passes, having these documents is useful.

### Locate or request

- [ ] **Birth certificate** - Request from the state where you were born ([VitalChek](https://www.vitalchek.com/) handles most states)
- [ ] **U.S. passport** - Apply or renew at [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov) (8-11 weeks standard, 4-6 weeks expedited)
- [ ] **Naturalization certificate** - If naturalized, locate yours or request a replacement through [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov)
- [ ] **REAL ID** - Check if your driver's license is REAL ID compliant (look for the ⭐ star symbol)

### If you've changed your name

- [ ] **Marriage certificate** - Locate the certified copy from the county where you married
- [ ] **Court order** - If name changed by court order, keep a certified copy
- [ ] **Update your passport** - Ensures your primary ID matches your current legal name
- [ ] **Update voter registration** - Make sure your name matches your ID at [secure.utah.gov/voterreg](https://secure.utah.gov/voterreg/index.html)

### Processing times

| Document | Typical wait time |
|----------|-------------------|
| U.S. passport (standard) | 8-11 weeks |
| U.S. passport (expedited) | 4-6 weeks |
| Birth certificate | 1-4 weeks |
| Naturalization certificate replacement | 5-8 months |
| Utah state ID | 6 weeks |

> **Why do this now?** If proof-of-citizenship requirements take effect, there will likely be a rush. Getting ahead of it costs nothing but a bit of time.
