## <u>SAVE Act (H.R. 22)</u>

The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act is a federal bill that would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. Under current law, voters attest to citizenship under penalty of perjury; the SAVE Act would require physical documents like a passport, birth certificate, or naturalization certificate. It would also eliminate online and mail-in voter registration, requiring everyone to appear in person at an election office with their documents. The bill passed the House in April 2025 but faces long odds in the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. About 21 million voting-age Americans lack easy access to the required documents.

## <u>HB300: Amendments to Election Law</u>

HB300 is a Utah state law signed by Governor Spencer Cox in March 2025. It ends Utah's universal vote-by-mail system, which has been in place since 2019. Starting January 1, 2029, voters must opt in to receive mail ballots rather than getting them automatically. The law also requires voters to write the last four digits of their driver's license or Social Security number on their ballot return envelope, shifting verification away from signature matching. Additionally, the grace period for mailed ballots was eliminated; ballots must now arrive by 8 PM on Election Day rather than being postmarked by that date. The law also provides free state ID cards for indigent voters who sign an affidavit.

## <u>HB479: Voting by Mail Requirements</u>

HB479 is a Utah state proposal introduced in February 2026 by House Speaker Mike Schultz. It would go significantly further than HB300 by requiring most voters to return their mail ballots in person at a polling place or drop box, presenting valid voter ID to a poll worker. The bill would require two poll workers to staff each drop box from 8 AM to 8 PM during the five days before Election Day. Voters with disabilities could request an exception to vote entirely by mail, and military service members would automatically qualify for full mail-in voting. Other voters could apply for a two-year mail-in designation from their county clerk. The bill mirrors a 2024 proposal that was scaled back into HB300; with renewed federal pressure to limit mail voting, it has gained new support but still faces uncertain prospects in the Senate.

| **Introduced** | February 2026 |
| **Track it** | [le.utah.gov](https://le.utah.gov/~2026/bills/static/HB0479.html) |

### What it would do

| Provision | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **In-person return** | Mail ballots must be returned in person at a polling place or drop box |
| **ID required** | Must show valid voter ID to a poll worker when returning ballot |
| **Mail-in designation** | Can request mail-in status from county clerk (valid for 2 years) |
| **Drop box staffing** | Two poll workers at each drop box, 8 AM–8 PM, 5 days before Election Day |
| **Drop box ratio** | One drop box required per 10,000 active registered voters |

### Exceptions

- **Voters with disabilities:** May request mail-in ballot via mail or email
- **Military service members:** Automatically qualify for mail-in voting
- **Mail-in designation holders:** Can return by mail for 2 years after approval

### Context

This bill is more restrictive than HB300. It mirrors a proposal from 2024 that was scaled back. With increased federal pressure to limit mail voting, it has renewed support but still faces uncertain prospects in the Senate.
