## <u>SAVE Act (H.R. 22) — Superseded</u>

The original SAVE Act passed the House in April 2025 but stalled in the Senate. It has been superseded by H.R. 7296, the SAVE America Act (see below), which includes everything in H.R. 22 plus additional ID requirements.

## <u>SAVE America Act (H.R. 7296)</u>

The SAVE America Act is an expanded version of H.R. 22 that adds photo ID requirements for in-person voting and ID verification for absentee ballots. It passed the House on February 11, 2026, on a near-party-line vote. Like its predecessor, the bill requires documentary proof of citizenship to register, eliminates online and mail-in registration, and mandates in-person document presentation. The expanded requirements were reportedly added at President Trump's request. About 21 million voting-age Americans lack easy access to the required citizenship documents, and a Brennan Center survey found roughly 9% of voting-age Americans don't have readily available citizenship documentation.

### What it would do

| | Current Law | SAVE America Act |
|---|-------------|----------|
| **What you prove** | Identity (attestation of citizenship) | Citizenship (documentary proof) |
| **How you register** | Online, by mail, or in person | In person only |
| **Documents needed** | Photo ID or two non-photo docs | Passport, birth certificate, or similar |
| **In-person voting ID** | State rules apply | Government-issued photo ID required |
| **Absentee ballots** | State rules apply | Must submit ID copy when requesting and returning |
| **Noncitizen removal** | State-by-state processes | Mandated federal process |

### Key provisions

- Everything from H.R. 22: documentary proof of citizenship to register, no online/mail registration, in-person document presentation
- Government-issued photo ID required to vote in person in federal elections
- ID copy required when requesting and casting absentee ballots
- Mandated federal process for removing noncitizens from voter rolls

### Senate outlook

The bill needs 60 votes to clear a filibuster. Republicans hold 53 seats, so at least 7 Democrats would need to cross over. Several Republican senators have pushed back:

- **Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)** opposes it, calling it federal overreach
- **Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)** has called the expanded version "problematic"
- **Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY)** has long insisted elections should be managed by states

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) is exploring a "talking filibuster" approach, and there's discussion of attaching provisions to must-pass legislation (like an intelligence funding bill in April). Neither strategy currently has enough support.

## <u>HB300: Amendments to Election Law</u>

HB300 is a Utah state law signed by Governor Spencer Cox in March 2025. It ends Utah's universal vote-by-mail system, which has been in place since 2019. Starting January 1, 2029, voters must opt in to receive mail ballots rather than getting them automatically. The law also requires voters to write the last four digits of their driver's license or Social Security number on their ballot return envelope, shifting verification away from signature matching. Additionally, the grace period for mailed ballots was eliminated; ballots must now arrive by 8 PM on Election Day rather than being postmarked by that date. The law also provides free state ID cards for indigent voters who sign an affidavit.

| **Vote** | House 56-15, Senate 19-10 |
| **Track it** | [le.utah.gov](https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0300.html) |

### Timeline

| Change | Effective Date |
|--------|----------------|
| Ballot deadline (8 PM Election Day) | Immediate |
| Last 4 digits of ID on envelope | Immediate |
| Free state ID for indigent voters | Immediate |
| Mail ballot opt-in required | Jan 1, 2029 |

### What it does

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Mail ballot opt-in** | Starting Jan 1, 2029, you must request mail ballots (no longer automatic) |
| **Ballot deadline** | Must be received by 8 PM Election Day (grace period eliminated) |
| **ID on envelope** | Last 4 digits of driver's license or SSN required on return envelope |
| **Signature verification** | Shifts toward ID number verification instead of signature matching |
| **Free state ID** | Indigent voters can get a free state ID card |

### Implementation so far

Utah County tested the four-digit ID requirement during the August 2025 municipal primaries. The results raised concerns: **790 ballots had mismatched signatures but correct four-digit ID numbers**, suggesting the new system may be less secure than signature matching alone. Weber County Clerk Ricky Hatch noted that forging a signature is harder than obtaining someone's last four ID digits, especially within the same household. Utah County chose not to repeat the test for the November 2025 elections.

These findings are driving corrective legislation in the 2026 session:

- **SB194** (Sen. Mike McKell): Would require county clerks to continue using ballot affidavits for identity verification even when valid ID numbers are provided
- **HB311** (Rep. Jefferson Burton): Would restore signature affidavit requirements alongside ID number verification

### How to opt in for mail voting

You can request mail-in ballot status when you:
- Renew your state ID or driver's license
- Register to vote
- Vote in person
- Fill out a form on the Lt. Governor's website
- Submit a form at your county clerk's office

## <u>HB479: Voting by Mail Requirements</u>

HB479 is a Utah state proposal introduced in February 2026 by House Speaker Mike Schultz. It would go significantly further than HB300 by requiring most voters to return their mail ballots in person at a polling place or drop box, presenting valid voter ID to a poll worker. The bill would require two poll workers to staff each drop box from 8 AM to 8 PM during the five days before Election Day. Voters with disabilities could request an exception to vote entirely by mail, and military service members would automatically qualify for full mail-in voting. Other voters could apply for a two-year mail-in designation from their county clerk. The bill mirrors a 2024 proposal that was scaled back into HB300; with renewed federal pressure to limit mail voting, it has gained new support but still faces uncertain prospects in the Senate.

| **Status** | In committee |
| **Introduced** | February 2026 |
| **Track it** | [le.utah.gov](https://le.utah.gov/~2026/bills/static/HB0479.html) |

### What it would do

| Provision | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **In-person return** | Mail ballots must be returned in person at a polling place or drop box |
| **ID required** | Must show valid voter ID to a poll worker when returning ballot |
| **Mail-in designation** | Can request mail-in status from county clerk (valid for 2 years) |
| **Drop box staffing** | Two poll workers at each drop box, 8 AM–8 PM, 5 days before Election Day |
| **Drop box ratio** | One drop box required per 10,000 active registered voters |

### Exceptions

- **Voters with disabilities:** May request mail-in ballot via mail or email
- **Military service members:** Automatically qualify for mail-in voting
- **Mail-in designation holders:** Can return by mail for 2 years after approval

### Context

This bill is more restrictive than HB300. It mirrors a proposal from 2024 that was scaled back. With increased federal pressure to limit mail voting, it has renewed support but still faces uncertain prospects in the Senate. The estimated implementation cost exceeds **$10 million** (primarily for staffing drop boxes statewide), which has drawn Senate concern. The 2026 legislative session ends in early March, so the bill would need to move quickly to pass this year.
