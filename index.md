# [Journals of The Fox Den](./)

A loosely organized collection of notes, guides, and the occasional rant. Things I've figured out the hard way so maybe you don't have to. Co-authored with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

No schedule. No algorithm. Just stuff I thought was worth writing down.

## Guides

- [Identity & Financial Hardening Guide](identity-hardening-guide.md) - A checklist for locking down your credit, accounts, and personal information. Because the corporations losing your data certainly aren't going to protect you.
- [The No-Nonsense Guide to Raising Your Credit Score](credit-score-guide.md) - Practical advice for building and maintaining a high credit score. No fluff, just what actually works.
- [Surviving the SAVE Act](surviving-the-save-act.md) - What the proposed citizenship-proof voting law means for you, plus how to verify your Utah voter registration and signature.

*More to come, eventually, probably.*
